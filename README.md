# Regular Languages are Closed Under Complement

This is a final programming project for Theory of Computation. The purpose of this project is to provide a visual demonstration of how every regular language can have a complement DFA that is the complement.

## Description

Provide a more detailed description of the project. For example:

- What problem it solves  
- The technologies or languages used (e.g., Python, JavaScript, C)  
- Any important algorithms or concepts (e.g., DFA simulation, file processing, machine learning)  

## Features

List the key features or functionality of your project. Example:

- Simulates deterministic finite automata (DFA)  
- Supports custom input strings and alphabets  
- Visualizes DFA transitions (if applicable)  
- Allows saving/loading DFA definitions from JSON  

## Installation

Explain how to set up the project locally. Example:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
